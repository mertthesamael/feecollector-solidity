So this is the basic Smart Contract - FrontEnd communication practice that is works on Polygon Mumbai Testnet. Basically you can send some amount direct to the contract, but in order to withdraw it, you need to be OWNER of the contract.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
